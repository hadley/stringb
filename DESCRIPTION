Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Hadley",
             family = "Wickham",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "hadley@rstudio.com"),
      person(given = "RStudio",
             role = "cph"))
Description: This is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for stringr, but it has
    no dependencies. This makes it suitable for use in packages where stringr's
    stringi dependency would otherwise be unwieldy.
